### Assembly
##### Step 1
![IMG_5450](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae427760-48c6-42ca-a157-d0d45951279f)
Remove the printed supports and adhesion materials from the part.

##### Step 2
![IMG_5456](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/841fea38-dd3e-4964-bad8-56c50d706550)
Use a soldering iron to insert the 4 terminal heatset inserts.

Insert the M3 terminal bolts and washers into the inserts.

##### Step 3

Separate the individual strands, and remove the twists as much as possible.

##### Step 4
![IMG_5472](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aecbb077-a0d6-4f99-9d3f-bc12162dbeeb)
Route the wires through the wire channel as shown.

##### Step 5
![IMG_5474](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b955935-f06e-4d19-9a81-9847116cd8b5)
Cut a 250mm length of LED strip.

![IMG_5477](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14e4b9b2-1c33-4163-beda-d27d1b5fd202)
Adhere this around the edge of the light.

##### Step 6
![IMG_5483](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/779c18d6-2a13-40ce-9836-93ad20a5b3a0)
Carefully solder the 4 wires to the 5V, GND, D+ and D- pins. This is very fiddly, and may require multiple attempts.

##### Step 7
![IMG_5487](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e822df94-444c-40fa-b645-e2d7f12e8960)
Route the wires out the wire hole, and spread them to each of their terminals. 

![IMG_5489](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27e75339-fe23-46c1-b7b1-a27088053dc7)
Loop each wire around a bolt and tighten, ensuring there is no insulation clamped under the screw.

##### Step 8
![IMG_5492](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9311b3dc-d7b0-4039-a8b1-380081bbcf4a)
Use a multimeter to check check for short circuts in the assembly.

##### Step 9
![IMG_5493](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04b68bc6-c930-4860-918d-e0dd10669eff)
Cut out a triangular section of foil to act as the reflector.

![IMG_5494](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f50a2c9-6cbc-4bfb-b0e3-0d998d2d1b19)
![IMG_5495](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6f8b6e3-dbe3-4cd4-a3d3-bb31d146b0b8)
Use a thin double sided tape to adhere the foil over the back panel.

>[!WARNING]
>Ensure the foil does not make contact with the LED strip or exposed wire. This could lead to a short circut!

##### Step 10
Repeat for all other desired modules. Attach the lasercut or 3D printed diffuser and bezel.
